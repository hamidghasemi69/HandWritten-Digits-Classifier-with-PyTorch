# HandWritten-Digits-Classifier-with-PyTorch
Designing and Training Neural Networks to Classify Handwritten Digits Using MNIST dataset

# Project Overview: Digist Classification on MNIST dataset
In this project, I preprocessed a dataset for handwritten digit recognition, built a neural network, and then trained and tuned the network using the MNIST dataset. The goal was to develop an effective model capable of recognizing handwritten digits with high accuracy.
