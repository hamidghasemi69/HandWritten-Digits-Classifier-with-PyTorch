# HandWritten-Digits-Classifier-with-PyTorch
Designing and Training Neural Networks to Classify Handwritten Digits Using MNIST dataset

# Project Overview: Digist Classification on MNIST dataset
In this project, I preprocessed a dataset for handwritten digit recognition, built a neural network, then trained and tuneed that neural network using MNIST dataset.
