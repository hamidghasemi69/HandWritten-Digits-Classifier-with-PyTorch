# HandWritten-Digits-Classifier-with-PyTorch

**Designing and Training Neural Networks to Classify Handwritten Digits Using MNIST dataset**

This project focuses on developing a robust neural network using PyTorch to accurately classify handwritten digits. The main aim was to achieve a remarkable accuracy of at least 90% on the test set. The project involved loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, constructing and training a neural network, evaluating its accuracy, and finally, saving the trained model.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Utilizes the MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9).
- **Model**: Implements a feedforward neural network using PyTorch's `torch.nn` module.
- **Objective**: Achieve high classification accuracy on the MNIST test set.

## Repository Structure

- **MNIST_Handwritten_Digits-STARTER.ipynb** — Jupyter notebook for building and training the model.
- **model1.pth** — Saved model weights after training.
- **README.md** — This file.

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/hamidghasemi69/HandWritten-Digits-Classifier-with-PyTorch.git`
   
   `cd HandWritten-Digits-Classifier-with-PyTorch`

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

   `jupyter notebook MNIST_Handwritten_Digits-STARTER.ipynb`

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, define the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.


## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of 90% on the MNIST test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of a simple feedforward neural network for digit classification.
